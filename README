This directory contains the sources of Minecraft Keyboard Fix.

Minecraft Keyboard Fix is a lightweight Minecraft Forge mod that performs
keyboard fix for Minecraft running on GNU/Linux distributions.

Users who play Minecraft on GNU/Linux might encounter an issue where the
"Shift-2" and "Shift-6" key combinations are not working, which is resolved by
this mod.

Minecraft Keyboard Fix supports Minecraft 1.8.9, 1.9.x, 1.10.x, 1.11.x, and
1.12.x. Since the keyboard issue no longer exists since Minecraft 1.13, this
mod does not, and needs not, be ported to that version or any later version of
the game.

Should any other keyboard issue in Minecraft on GNU/Linux be discovered, code
that fixes it could be added to this mod if available.

You can build and install this mod as if you are building and installing a
common Minecraft Forge mod. If you are unfamiliar with this procedure or
encounter any problem, you can see the file INSTALL.md to learn more about the
building and installation process.

Minecraft Keyboard Fix is free software. See the file COPYING for copying
conditions.
